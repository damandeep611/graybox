Inline HTML
You can also use HTML directly in Markdown if needed, like <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>.

You can copy and paste this template into a Markdown editor to see how it renders. It's a versatile format, commonly used for documentation, README files, and even blog posts.


The template covers most of the common Markdown elements, but there are a few more advanced or specialized features you might find useful:

1. **Footnotes**:
   ```markdown
   Here is a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

   [^1]: This is the footnote.
   ```

2. **Definition Lists**:
   ```markdown
   Term 1
   : Definition 1

   Term 2
   : Definition 2
   ```

3. **Strikethrough**:
   ```markdown
   ~~This text is strikethrough~~
   ```

4. **Emoji** (may not render in all Markdown editors):
   ```markdown
   :smile: :rocket: :tada:
   ```

5. **HTML Elements**:
   Markdown allows for inline HTML if you need more control over styling:
   ```markdown
   <div style="color: red;">This is a red text.</div>
   ```

6. **Task Lists with State** (can be interactive in some platforms):
   ```markdown
   - [x] Completed task
   - [ ] Incomplete task
   ```

7. **Links with Titles**:
   ```markdown
   [Google](https://www.google.com "Go to Google")
   ```

8. **Code Block with Line Numbers** (in some Markdown parsers):
   ```markdown
   ```python
   # This is a code block with syntax highlighting
   def hello_world():
       print("Hello, world!")
   ```
   ```

9. **Anchor Links** (for creating internal links):
   ```markdown
   [Go to Section](#section-heading)

   ## Section Heading
   ```

Markdown syntax can vary slightly depending on the platform or editor you're using, as some may support additional features or extensions.
