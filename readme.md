# 🧠 Learning Vault

This is my personal learning repo where I document, explore, and build stuff as I learn new tech.  
Each folder at the root focuses on a different domain — like React, Next.js, AI agents, backend, etc.

I use this repo as a dev second brain:  
- Small practice projects live in topic folders  
- Notes and resources go into READMEs  
- A [Fumadocs site](#docs) is also linked below for browsable notes

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists

I don’t want to keep relearning the same stuff. This repo helps me:
- Solidify concepts by building hands-on examples
- Collect high-quality resources in one place
- Revisit things later without digging through bookmarks or YouTube history
- Share learnings and help others (if they land here)

---

## 🔜 Coming Soon
- [ ] Backend folder (Node.js, Express, DB stuff)
- [ ] More AI agent tooling (AutoGen, CrewAI)
- [ ] Deployments (Vercel, Render, etc.)
- [ ] Design systems & component libraries

---

> . Still learning. Still shipping. 🚢
