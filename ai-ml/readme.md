## 🧠 AI Research Roadmap

A curated path through 7 years of breakthroughs — from the Transformer’s invention to modern LLM-based agents.

### 1️⃣ Architecture — *The Birth of Transformers*

* [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
  *Introduced the Transformer — attention replaces recurrence, enabling parallelism and massive scaling. The foundation of all modern language models.*

### 2️⃣ Scale — *Bigger Models, Better Results*

* [Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165)
  *Showed that large models develop “emergent” abilities without task-specific training. This paper introduced GPT-3 and scaling laws.*

### 3️⃣ Alignment — *Teaching Models to Behave*

* [Training Language Models to Follow Instructions with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155)
  *The birth of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This is what turned raw LMs into helpful assistants.*

### 4️⃣ Efficiency — *Smarter Training & Inference*

* [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685)
  *A lightweight fine-tuning method — adapt big models on small hardware by injecting low-rank updates.*
* [LLM.int8(): 8-bit Matrix Multiplication for Transformers at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07339)
  *Quantization breakthrough — run giant models efficiently with minimal performance loss.*

### 5️⃣ Augmentation — *Extending Model Knowledge*

* [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401)
  *Introduced RAG — combining retrieval and generation for dynamic, up-to-date knowledge access.*

### 6️⃣ Scaling Smarter — *Sparse and Modular Models*

* [Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03961)
  *Introduced mixture-of-experts — activate only parts of the model per input to scale efficiently.*

### 7️⃣ Compression — *Knowledge in Smaller Packages*

* [DistilBERT: A Distilled Version of BERT — Smaller, Faster, Cheaper and Lighter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.01108)
  *Showed how to “distill” knowledge from large teacher models into compact, efficient ones.*

### 8️⃣ Agency — *Models That Think and Act*

* [The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864)
  *Maps how LLMs evolve into autonomous agents — capable of planning, reasoning, and tool use.*
* [Introducing the Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)
  *Shows how agents can share state, context, and memory — the infrastructure of multi-agent systems.*

**💡 TL;DR mental model:**

> Transformers gave us the *brain*, scaling laws gave it *power*, RLHF gave it *manners*, LoRA and quantization gave it *efficiency*, RAG gave it *memory*, Switch Transformers gave it *scalability*, Distillation gave it *accessibility*, and Agents gave it *agency*.
